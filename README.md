## 📖 The Soul of EdgeSOM: Why We Exist
*Our algorithms aren't just logic; they are built on human experience.*

At EdgeSOM, we believe that "The reason why current companion AI feels pale is that there are no 'tears' in their code." 

Our founder is a survivor of severe depression (DFI 60%) who navigated through intense life pressures and personal loss. We have infused this **"Survivor's Empathy Logic"** into our AI interaction framework. We don't just provide robotic scripts; we provide a soul-level connection for those in their darkest moments.
